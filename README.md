## Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression with Bits-back Coding

### Dataset
Let's download and extract ShapeNetCore v2 dataset into a local folder, e.g.,
`~/open3d_data/extract/ShapeNet/`.

After that, run `python dataset.py` to create a point cloud dataset from the ShapeNet
dataset. This may take some time (less than 1 hour). 

Or to save time and skip this step, the preprocessed
train set and test set can be downloaded [here](https://www.google.com/)
